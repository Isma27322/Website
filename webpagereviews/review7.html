        <h2>Site design</h2> <!--The rateing I give to the main and seconday page of the webstie.-->
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 9 out of 10</li> <!--Rateing for the main page-->
            <li>I gave the main page design a rateing of 9 out of 10 because I really like the design, 
            <br>they make what they want you to see first what shows up first. They made it so that the info you needed to find or see is there first.
            <br>but one thing I don't like is that it can be a little overwellming for people that are first using the cite and it might be hard to find what you want.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Site usability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rateing: 9.6 out of 10</li>
            <li>I gave the main page a rateing of 9.6 out of 10 because I really like it everything is understandable.
            <br>You are able to find what you need within like 2 or 3 clicks of the main screen.
            <br>But what I dont really like is that for some of the infomation for the hosting plans,
            <br> you need to go all the way to the bottom and it is a lot of info and might be overwellming for some people.
            </li>
